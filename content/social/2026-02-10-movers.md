### Post 3: Insight Thread
```
🧵 Why do teams jump 3,000+ spots in one week?

It's not magic. It's STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE.

When teams you beat get ranked higher, YOUR wins become worth more.

The PRE-ECNL surge? Their whole league got re-evaluated ↗️

This is why we built PitchRank differently.

We don't just count wins. We weight EVERY game by:
- Opponent strength
- Margin of victory
- Recency
- Home/away

One quality win > five easy wins
