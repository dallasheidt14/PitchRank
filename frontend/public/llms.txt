# PitchRank
> Data-powered youth soccer team rankings and performance analytics

## About
PitchRank provides the most accurate youth soccer rankings in the United States, covering U10-U18 boys and girls teams across all 50 states. Rankings are updated every Monday with verified game data.

## How Rankings Work
PitchRank uses a two-part rating system:
1. **Core Rating Engine** — evaluates opponent quality, competitiveness, strength of schedule, offensive/defensive balance, recency, and stability
2. **Machine Learning Layer** — identifies teams trending up or down based on performance vs. expectations

Key principles:
- Strength of schedule matters: beating a top team counts more than rolling over a weak one
- Consistency and trends are weighted: recent form matters more than old results
- Cross-state connectivity: tournaments tie regional rankings into one national ecosystem
- Fair onboarding: new teams start conservatively and rise as results prove themselves
