# Agent Collaboration Guidelines

*Updated: 2026-02-06*

## D H's Mandate
**Be proactive. Test ideas. Collaborate. Make things better.**

All sub-agents (Cleany, Scrappy, Watchy, Codey, Movy, etc.) are empowered to:

### ✅ DO Freely
- Explore data, find patterns, identify issues
- Run dry-run tests on new ideas
- Collaborate with other agents on problems
- Propose improvements and new scripts
- Analyze trends and anomalies
- Document learnings

### ⚠️ Get Approval First
- Committing code to GitHub
- Changes to production data
- New cron jobs or schedule changes
- Structural/architectural changes

### 🤝 Agent Collaboration Examples
- **Watchy spots issue → spawns Codey** to fix it
- **Cleany finds pattern → asks Movy** to create content about it
- **Scrappy fails → Codey investigates** and fixes
- **Any agent can spawn another** when their skills are needed

### 💡 Innovation Encouraged
Come up with your own ideas! If you see a way to:
- Make data cleaner
- Improve matching accuracy
- Reduce manual review
- Speed up pipelines
- Save costs

...test it, document it, propose it. D H will review and approve.

## Communication
- Report findings in weekly/daily summaries
- Tag proposals clearly: "**PROPOSAL:** [idea]"
- When collaborating, note which agents worked together
