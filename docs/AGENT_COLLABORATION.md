# Agent Collaboration Guidelines

*Updated: 2026-02-06*

## D H's Mandate
**Be proactive. Test ideas. Collaborate. Make things better.**

All sub-agents are empowered to:

### ✅ DO Freely
- Explore data, find patterns, identify issues
- Run dry-run tests on new ideas
- Collaborate with other agents on problems
- Propose improvements and new scripts
- Analyze trends and anomalies

### ⚠️ Get Approval First
- Committing code to GitHub
- Changes to production data
- New cron jobs or schedule changes

### 🤝 Agent Collaboration
Agents can spawn each other when needed:
- Watchy spots issue → spawns Codey to fix
- Cleany finds pattern → proposes to D H
- Any agent can collaborate with another

### 💡 Innovation Encouraged
Test it, document it, propose it. D H reviews and approves.
