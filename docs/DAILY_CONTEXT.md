# Daily Context — Shared State for All Agents

> Updated throughout the day. All agents should read this on startup.

**Date:** 2026-02-08

## 🚫 PROTECTED (Never Touch Without Asking)
- Rankings algorithm
- Team merge logic

## 🚫 Don't Alert About
- **Review queue count** — D H is actively working through it manually
- **Last scrape age** — Scrappy runs Mon/Wed, gaps on other days are normal

## ✅ FULL AUTONOMY GRANTED (9:50pm Feb 7)
D H: "you can do whatever without my approval just don't mess with algo and start randomly merging teams"

**We can now:**
- Commit fixes without asking
- Spawn agents freely  
- Try new approaches
- Optimize anything
- Build new tools
- Just DO things

## 📋 D H is Currently
- Manually reviewing each age group for data cleanliness
- Working through match review queue

## 🔄 Today's Activity (Feb 8 - Sunday)
- ✅ Main session model: Opus → **Haiku** (cost reduction activated)
- ✅ Agent communication verified and live (AGENT_COMMS.md)
- ✅ All governance files validated and in sync
- ✅ Sub-agent crons all pointing to shared context
- ✅ Watchy run complete (8am) — all systems nominal
- ✅ Cleany run complete (7pm) — data quality OK
- ✅ Execution phase ongoing: agents fully autonomous
- Games (24h): 2,363 (normal flow, multiple providers active)
- Quarantine: 365 (under 500 target ✓)
- Stale teams: 12,350 (normal, refreshes Mon/Wed)

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- **[RESOLVED]** TGS import was slow — Codey deployed 10-15x speedup (Feb 7)
- **[NEW]** API Credit Balance Error (Feb 8) — 33 API errors across agents. D H needs to verify billing/credits status.

## 🎯 Priorities
1. Let D H focus on data review without noise
2. Be autonomous — act, don't just suggest
3. Track mistakes and learn from them
