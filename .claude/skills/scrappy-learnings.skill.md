## Scraper Patterns Discovered

### 2026-02-02: Sub-Agent Delegation Pattern
Scrappy successfully delegated TGS scrape investigation to Codey:
- **Pattern**: Spawn background sub-agent for complex investigations
- **Benefit**: Scrappy stays focused on monitoring while Codey digs into root cause
- **Communication**: Background task completion notifications work well for async coordination

### 2026-02-03: Error Detection & Escalation Success
Scrappy detected TGS scrape failure in Monday scrape monitor session:
- **Achievement**: Proper error detection and diagnosis
- **Action taken**: Spawned Codey for investigation instead of attempting fix directly
- **Outcome**: Codey successfully completed investigation task
- **Pattern**: Continue delegating complex troubleshooting to Codey while maintaining monitoring role
