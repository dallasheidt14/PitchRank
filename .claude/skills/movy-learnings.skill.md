## Content Patterns That Work

- **Numbers + narrative** wins: Always pair rank movements with the story (wins, losses, margins) — parents want to understand WHY
- **Confidence signaling**: When algorithm is working well, explicitly say so ("Data is speaking. Rankings are WORKING.")

## Ranking Movement Insights

- **Feb 24 observation:** Large movements (1600+ spot jumps) driven by:
  - Recent game results (wins/losses in 1-2 days)
  - Strength of schedule recalculation (when opponents improve/decline)
  - Blowout losses especially punishing (0-6, 1-5 moves cause 1000+ spot drops)
- **Margin of victory matters:** Teams with 5-goal losses to lower-ranked opponents see 30-40% PowerScore drops
- **Healthy indicator:** Movement correlates to actual game results — algorithm showing correct behavior

## Social Media Best Practices

- **Emoji-first engagement:** Lead with 📈 📉 for visual scanning
- **Specific narratives win:** "Lost to same team twice, 1-5 each" > generic "team dropped"
- **Regional call-outs:** Tag states (CA, PA, NC, TX, etc.) to drive local interest
- **Always validate data quality** before publishing — check for stale games or SOS-only moves
