-- =====================================================
-- Step 5: Create indexes for performance
-- =====================================================

-- Note: Cannot create indexes on views directly, but the underlying tables
-- (games, teams, rankings_full) should already have appropriate indexes
-- If performance is slow, consider creating a materialized view instead
