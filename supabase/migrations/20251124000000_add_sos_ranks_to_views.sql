-- Add SOS rank fields to rankings views
-- Date: 2025-11-24
-- Purpose: Expose pre-calculated sos_rank_national and sos_rank_state from rankings_full
--          to eliminate client-side SOS rank calculation

-- =====================================================
-- Step 1: Drop existing views
-- =====================================================

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS state_rankings_view CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS rankings_view CASCADE;

-- =====================================================
-- Step 2: Recreate rankings_view with SOS rank fields

-- =====================================================
-- Notes
-- =====================================================
-- This migration adds sos_rank_national and sos_rank_state fields from rankings_full
-- to both rankings_view and state_rankings_view. These fields are pre-calculated by
-- the rankings engine (calculator.py) and eliminate the need for client-side SOS rank
-- calculation in the frontend.
--
-- SOS Rank fields:
-- - sos_rank_national: Rank within (age, gender) cohort across ALL states (highest SOS = 1)
-- - sos_rank_state: Rank within (age, gender, state) (highest SOS = 1)
--
-- Frontend should use:
-- - sos_rank_national when viewing national rankings
-- - sos_rank_state when filtering by a specific state
