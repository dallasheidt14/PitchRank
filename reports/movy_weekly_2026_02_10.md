## 🔍 KEY PATTERNS

### ⚠️ PRE-Team Anomaly (Climbers)
**All top climbers are "PRE-" teams (PRE-ECNL, PRE-ACADEMY) with ZERO recent game data.**

- Movement is purely SOS-driven
- No scheduled games being recorded
- Possible explanations:
  1. PRE-teams aren't being scraped from sources
  2. Academy divisions lack game scheduling
  3. Data quality issue where games aren't attributed to PRE-teams

**Recommendation:** Verify with Ranky that PRE-team games are being scraped and attributed correctly.

### ✅ Fallers Are Legitimate
**All big drops have recent game data confirming the movement.**
- Every faller has 1-3 recent losses
- Movement is explained by playing poorly
- Ranking algorithm working as intended

### State Focus
- **CA:** 2 top 5 fallers (San Diego region active)
- **TX:** 2 top 5 fallers (competitive weekend)
- **NY, OH:** Climbers in northeast/midwest
